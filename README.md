## My process

I started with HTML, then CSS desktop, then mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about Git and github, how to commit and push.
Learn about doing a basic HTML page and basic CSS style.
Learn to import font.
Learn about parent and child element.
Learn about finding informations like official documentation, stack overflow.

### Continued development

Need to keep learning about some basic semantic like h1, h2 etc. Being more fluid in my code, I think I can have the same result especially in CSS way faster and with less lines. Be more organize in my code. Also I need to have a better understanding of designs to see my HTML skeleton only with it.
